I'm picky about headphones - not because I'm an audiophile, but because I love music. And television. And movies. And the ability to listen to all of it without interruption. So headphones save the day for me. Every day.

I listen on planes - so active noise cancelling headphones make flying work for me. On road trips, I listen in the car and can't hear the kids. And when I'm working in my home office, I listen to studio headphones while I work.

Did I mention that I also like to listen as I fall asleep? I can't tell you how many pairs of headphones I've broken. But hey, it's not my fault. Apparently that's a scenario most companies don't pay attention to.

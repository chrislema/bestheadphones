My buddy Steve and I would get on the BART subway system in Northern California's Bay Area every morning. We'd spend about an hour on the train as we headed to our office in San Francisco. And each morning we'd put in headphones to listen to our own music or audiobooks.

Most mornings we had our routine down. No issues. No problems. But if you've ever spent time on a subway train, you have likely experienced that moment when someone sitting close to you had headphones on and you can still hear their music. Well, that happened to us one morning.

Only, here's the thing - we were wearing our own headphones. Not fancy ones - just the new white ones that came with Apple iPods. But still! We had headphones in. Someone else had their own on, and we could still hear their music louder than our own!

That's what can happen when you use open-back headphones. Sound leaks. On purpose. And on trains it's a bad thing. But in my home office, I don't mind it at all - since I'm the only one here.

Which brings us to the question - which is better, open-back or closed-back headphones?

## Open-Back or Closed-Back Headphones - Which is better?

**When are open-back headphones the right choice?**

Open-back headphones are best when you don't have to worry about others hearing your music. Open-back headphones are best when you want to enjoy your music as if you were listening to a nice stereo in your living room.

Open-back headphones deliver a better experience when you're listening for long periods of time, want to be aware of your surroundings (because sound comes in), and don't mind that some sound is leaking (as it goes out the open back).

Normally, I'd tell you to check out headphones like the [**AKG Pro Audio K712 **](https://amzn.to/2Da6M0f "AKG Pro Audio K712")or [**Sennheiser HD 600**](https://amzn.to/2XNzIED "Sennheiser HD 600")**.** 

But this review is for the [**Massdrop Focal Elex**](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-focal-elex-headphones/ "Focal ") because they're my new favorites! We'll get there in a just a second....but first, 

**When are closed-back headphones the right choice?**

Closed-back headphones are what I use most. That's because I'm on planes a lot - and the guy or gal sitting next to me didn't sign up to hear my music. When I visit our company's offices, I sit next to co-workers who have their own music preferences - so again, it's not a great place for open-back headphones.

Closed-back headphones are great when you want isolation. They're great when you don't want the rest of the world to intrude on your time listening to music. When you want to focus on what you're hearing, they're the best.

This is when I tell you that my favorites continue to be the [**Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM3 by Sony**](https://amzn.to/2pOQJlt "Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM3 by Sony")**.**

## The Focal Elex open-backed headphones

**Where did these come from?**

If you've never heard of Focal, what you likely should know is that they make speakers. That's important because when it comes to enjoying music when you put these headphones on, it feels like you're listening to speakers more than headphones. And that's not something that's easy to do.

Focal had three pairs of headphones that I was aware of - [Elear](https://amzn.to/35vqcJ2 "Focal Elear") ($500), [Clear](https://amzn.to/2Oh8hQn "Focal Clear") ($1000), and [Utopia](https://amzn.to/2riASff "Focal Utopia") ($4000). The reviews had ranged from interesting to great but the price points suggested I might never get the Utopias on my ears.

Thankfully, Drop, formerly of Massdrop fame, does what it does. It finds tech like headphones and an audience and then works with the manufacturer to help provide enough feedback and suggestions to get a custom version.

That's how the Focal Elex came to be. [**You can find them here**](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-focal-elex-headphones "Focal Elex Headphones").

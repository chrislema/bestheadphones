Stepping onto the plane, wearing my new AirPods Pro, I was ready to try a pair of noise cancelling headphones that didn’t require me to take off my hat.

To be clear, I wasn’t taking any chances. I had, in my backpack, my standard [Sony WH1000xM3 Over the Ear Noise Cancelling headphones](https://amzn.to/2Nj4DVR "Best wireless Bluetooth noise cancelling over the ear headphones"). Those are my all time favorites. I was also carrying their sister, the [Sony WF1000xM3](https://amzn.to/2JV79PZ "Sony’s competitor to the new AirPods Pro") - which we’re released before these AirPods Pro, as a direct competitor.
